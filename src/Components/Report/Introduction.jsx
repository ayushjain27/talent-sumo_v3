          The AI algorithms rate each answer of the candidate to distribute them into four groups or cohorts, for each of the parameters we are tracking.
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              Cohort A: Top 25% of the responses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cohort B: Top 50% of the responses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cohort C: Bottom 50% of the responses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cohort D: Bottom 25% of the responses.
            </li>
          </ol>
          These cohorts provide an estimate in terms of what separates top performers from the rest. Our approach is not to provide micro ratings of each
          parameter but a high-level comparison that provides a relative rankings of the candidate.
        </p>
        <p align='justify'>
          Our models suggest an overall rate of “Shortlisted” for the candidate. We understand that for each job and culture the preferences can be different hence we also report a comprehensive rating of the candidate across multiple skill dimensions (these are elaborated in Page 2 of the report) as displayed in the table below. Some of the natural pointers on how the candidates might improve are also suggested in the pages that follow.
