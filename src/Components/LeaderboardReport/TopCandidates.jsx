          Each interaction is analyzed via our HCI models (Human-Computer Interaction) to detect the content accuracy and the way the
          content is delivered. Our model tracks basic elements (detailed later) and converts them into proprietary indicators.

          The AI algorithms rate each answer of the candidate to distribute them into four groups or cohorts, for each of the
          parameters we are tracking.
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              Cohort A: Top 25% of the responses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cohort B: Top 50% of the responses.

            <li>
              Cohort C: Bottom 50% of the response.

          These cohorts provide an estimate in terms of what separates top performers from the rest. Our approach is not to provide
          micro ratings of each parameter but a high-level comparison that provides a relative rankings of the candidate. The current
          report is a leaderboard ranking of all ""shorlisted"" candidates i.e who are rated in the cohort A by the algorithm. This
          leaderboard is provide for hiring and training usage.
